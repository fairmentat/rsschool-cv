        work done using WinForms. In 2019, studied Java, in connection with this, purchased the JavaRush online course,
        completely covered Java Syntax and Java Core topics, solved more than 400 practical tasks, partially read Herbert Schildt’s
        books “Java 8. A Guide for Beginners,” “Learning Java »Sierra Katie. As part of the university’s curriculum, the Weather
